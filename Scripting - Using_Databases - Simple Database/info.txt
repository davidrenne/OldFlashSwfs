 There are two action frames. First one sets the variables
 and loads the database from "database.txt" into the
 variable called BASE. 
 Second one displays data on the screen.

 
 HOW IS THE DATABASE.TXT BUILD
 ==================================================================
 RECORD is 120 char's long. Each record contains three
 fields (eg. Name, EMail, Address). Each field is 40
 char's long.
 When creating a database file it is importent NOT to place any
 newline between recorda or fields. When i did i couldn't make it
 work.

 HOW IS THE RECORD BUILD
 ==================================================================

 My Name               My e-Mail	     My Address
 |=========40=========||=========40=========||=========40=========|
         Field 1               Field 2               Field 3

 |===============================120==============================|
                               Record 1





 Have fun!

Hello............

I worked on this one for 4 days and i think now it's ready to let you see it :o)

I don't earn all the credit for this preloader because the whole thing is 
stuffed with parts from the example files that can be found
on the Flashkit Movie section.

So the real credits goto the Flashkit founders :o) and those who uploaded 
their free to use fla files.

Nevertheless (don't know if that's real english :o) I hope you like it.

Please drop a line in my mailbox or ICQ when you are using (parts) of it.

That would make it more simple for me to file a complaint against someone in court !!!!!!!!
Ha ha ha ha......... no serious, just out of curiosity.

My mail adress is:
m.staal@chello.nl

My ICQ number is:

Kind regards,

PSST! I know that this pokeball dosen't look like the pokeball used in
the cartoon but I decided to make it like that so that I don't break any
copyright laws. Also the circle isn't quite a circle because I'm hopeless
at drawing stuff, if you focus at the spinning things you'll find that the circle
is imperfect. If you know of a way to make perfect circles then please e-mail
me and tell me!

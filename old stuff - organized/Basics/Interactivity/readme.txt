I used Flash 5 so you will have to have it also to open the fla.
All of the small pics on the .swf load larger pics in seperate swf movies on level 4.

I only included one .fla file for the drop down pics for two reasons.  
1:to conserve file size of the zip
2:that is the only file I used.

to update all the other drop down pics I only clicked on the pic in the library and broused for a new pic.  Then moved and resized the pic in the movieclip and saved the .swf

Each of the small pics were saved as 1"high 72dpi 20% compression
Each of the larger pics are 4" high 72dpi 50% compression

I also have on the website, music which is just a streaming .swf movie I loaded on to level 3.  Still a work in progress on the website but thought that the layout and use of tell targets could help.  

Website address is http://www.bbaspecialevents.com if you want to look at it.  I should finish the rest of the site soon.

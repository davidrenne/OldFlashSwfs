SAUSAGE LINKS WITH APRICOT-
MUSTARD GLAZE 
 
  
A sweet-and-hot glaze dresses up purchased breakfast links. If you prefer extra spice, use 
the sausages labeled "hot and sweet links." 
1/2 cup apricot preserves 
1/4 cup sweet-hot mustard 
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
18 ounces breakfast sausage links (such as pork links or hot and sweet links; about 20 
links) 

Whisk apricot preserves in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until melted and 
smooth, about 1 minute. Add mustard and whisk until beginning to simmer, about 30 
seconds. Remove from heat. Stir in chopped rosemary. Season glaze to taste with salt and 
pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Stir over medium heat until 
heated through.) 

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausages and sauté until 
browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer to saucepan with glaze. Stir 
over medium heat until sausages are glazed, about 1 minute. Transfer to platter and serve. 
Makes 8 servings.

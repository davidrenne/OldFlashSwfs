sorry for this. the code is horrible. the effect is cool tho. was really just me playing around.the movie clip is duplicated 6 times and added round the original making 1 ringanother ring with a lower alpha is made around thatand a third ring can be made also.I played around with the alpha's and number of rings until i got a decent image.the blur slider increases the rings radius from the original.the zoom increases the size of all clips.good luck figuring the rest out.email me if your stuck on: flash@isoma.net I check it occasionally

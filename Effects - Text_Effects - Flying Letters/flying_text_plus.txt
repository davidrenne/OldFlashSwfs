please note:
The idea for the flying text effect was not invented by me.
I found it at several sites across the web.
My work was the developement of the rotation stuff.

To thank all the people who provide the good tutorials on the web I want to
give away this file for free.

You may use and modify the actionscript as long as you make your own results public 
just like this one. 

If you link to my site http://www.onlinegeneration.com or mention it in your credits
I would be very honoured!

Cheers,

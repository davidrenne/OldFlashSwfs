The Bar

     This recreates a scroll bar effect. Although there is a calculation you can make to get the distence, I usually just plug in numbers a couple of times to get the bar to line up and what-not. Good for scrolling text or sections of a web-page.

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or any where else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.systern.com or witness my wrath. As always, I am not responsible if you or your computer get hurt in any way fatal, or partial, during,before, or after the use of this file.

I hope you find this usefull, and spread the love around. Drive safely!

EMotion

     This is a pretty basic effect, you have probably seen it on many sites: A caption hovers above the button when it is rolled over, the caption follows the mouse untill it moves away from the button. If you want to make more than one button, you will have to add a Stop Drag action On Rollout. 

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or any where else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.systern.com or witness my wrath. As always, I am not responsible if you or your computer get hurt in any way fatal, or partial, during,before, or after the use of this file.

I hope you find this usefull, and spread the love around. Drive safely!

Twang

     Complicating gravity even more, here the middle square gravitates towards the four outer squeares, each of which gravitate toward an anchor point, creating some interesting "twanging" effects. To really understand this experiement, you would have to take a look at some of the simpler excercises such as "ball 'n chain" (conveniently located at http://www.thinkit.com). You can still have ignorant fun by changing the variables in the "Variables" layer.

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or anywhere else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.thinkit.com or witness my wrath. As always, I am not responsible if you or your computer get hurt in any way fatal, or partial, during, before, or after the use of this file.

I hope you find this usefull, and spread the love around. Drive safely!

     Putting everything together, this experiment utilizes a scroll bar that moves depending on when you picked it up and let it go. Attached to this scroll bar is an info slice which reveals certain section depending on which way the scroll bar is moved. This is a very good way to create efficient, and fun scrolling.

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or any where else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.systern.com or witness my wrath.

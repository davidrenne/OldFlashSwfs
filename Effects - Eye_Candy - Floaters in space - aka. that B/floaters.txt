Floaters in space - Aka the B2 effect

This is a series of nested movie clips containing a single shape, floater.

Floater was created in Flash as a simple square with no border. I have used other shapes
such as stars, lines,  and trapezoids. Trapezoids work well to give the end display a little depth.
To get that "blurred" effect simply select your shape (without edges) and select soften edges from
the Modify>Curves pull-down menu. I used a distance of 16 px and a number of steps of 12 px on
this example. Other combinations can obtain different results, so you may want to play with it a
little.

Then "floater" was placed in a series of other movie clips where the shape tweens in from 
small to large, transparent to visable, and a drastic change in position.

All of these can be altered to create different effects or speeds. I inserted a mid keyframe
and adjusted the easing of the tween on either side to produce that "stall" effect evident in the B2
presentation, but you can remove the keyframe if you wish.

Now that the motion is mailed down the movie clips can be inserted in to your movie or assembled
into an array (another movieclip). If you label your instances well, you can call to the individual
motions as I have by using the Tell target command or you can simply drop the non-repeating clips into
your main timeline. 

If you chose to create an array, you can then tween the array to make it fell as if you are travelling
down a tunnel. 

I hope this is useful. 

I'd like to know if you use this anywhere. let me know.

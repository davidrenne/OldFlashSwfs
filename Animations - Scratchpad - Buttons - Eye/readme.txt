I created this mystic ball for my website above, it's just a bit of fun, try not to take the answers to heart.

Oh yes that reminds me 

I can not be held responsible for any actions resulting from answers given by the mystic ball taken by any party or persons using the mystic ball. 
:)

Anyway

You can use this ball on your own website, providing you put a link to the teenagepages website.

If for commercial use please contact me at

Adding Answers

goto the ask again scene, and in the action layer Frame 1, you will see the following code

num = random ( 20 );
if (num == 0) {
    message = "Don't be in such a hurry";
}
if (num == 1) {
    message = "don't count on it";
}
if (num == 2) {
    message = "you wish";
}
if (num == 3) {
    message = "Sorry to say but NO!!!";
}
if (num == 4) {
    message = "most likely";
}
if (num == 5) {
    message = "It will come in time";
}
if (num == 6) {
    message = "count on it";
}
if (num == 7) {
    message = "seek higher sources";
}
if (num == 8) {
    message = "you already know the answer";
}
if (num == 9) {
    message = "look in side yourself";
}
if (num == 10) {
    message = "soon, all will be revealed";
}
if (num == 11) {
    message = "WAIT";
}
if (num == 12) {
    message = "As I see it yes";
}
if (num == 13) {
    message = "very doubtful";
}
if (num == 14) {
    message = "ask again later";
}
if (num == 15) {
    message = "It is certain";
}
if (num == 16) {
    message = "can not predict now";
}
if (num == 17) {
    message = "My reply is NO";
}
if (num == 18) {
    message = "better not tell you now";
}
if (num == 19) {
    message = "signs point to YES";
}
if (num == 20) {
    message = "The outlook is good";
}

to add new answers change the number in in the following line to what ever number of answers you want i.e
num = random ( 21 );

Then add these lines changing the number to the next consecutive number.
if (num == 21) {
    message = "Your message here";
}

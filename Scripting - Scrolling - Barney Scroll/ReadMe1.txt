     Similar to the Barneys or Onyro web-page, this effect shifts a scrolling image to a certain coordinate. Although the effect looks complicated, basically what you are doing is getting the 1/2 point (or in this case, the 1/9) between the object and it's target, and moving the object to those coordinates. If you want to make it move faster, change the /9 action to a lower number, although if you go to low, the animation becomes choppy. 

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or any where else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.systern.com or witness my wrath. As always, I am not responsible if you or your computer get hurt in any way fatal, or partial, during, before, or after the use of this file.

I hope you find this usefull, and spread the love around. Drive safely!

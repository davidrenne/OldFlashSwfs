This is my first attempt at using ActionScript, and I know it's loaded with repetitive code and probably even a few mistakes, but as I said it's my first attempt.  I'm happy with the end result 
I'd love it if you send me your modifications so I can see better ways to do what I've done, so feel free to email them to me at the above address.

Use this for whatever you want.

cityhotel=The City Hotel was erected in 1905 by the McRobert brothers of Lafayette, Indiana.  It was built of “double space cement blocks” produced by a machine expressly for that purpose.  The hotel cost $40,000 and had 60 rooms.  It featured a long veranda and for a time, was rated as the “poshest” hotel in town.
The building then became the Winston Hotel and is currently known as Nevada Nickels Hotel.

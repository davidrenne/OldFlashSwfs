boles=After the 1891 fire, Bole purchased this site and built a wood frame drug store, which was destroyed almost immediately by the 1892 fire.  He rebuilt in brick, utilizing the style typical of commercial buildings in the 1890's – flat roof, large plate windows decorated with stained glass, ornamental brick work and corner entrance.
Moose Jaw Drug and Stationery took over and in 1905 the building was extended along River Street.  The city’s first ever soda fountain was installed at the unheard of cost of $5,000 in 1909.
The building is now Treats R Us, a coffee shop that sells an assortment of treats, including ice cream.  The extension along River Street is now Flower Potts, a shop specializing in garden accessories and a variety of gift items.

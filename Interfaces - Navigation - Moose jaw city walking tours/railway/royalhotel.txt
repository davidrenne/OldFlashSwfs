royalhotel=The Neil McMillan building built in 1909 and the Turnbull Block built in 1910 were consolidated to form the Royal Hotel.  The third floor of the Turnbull Block housed the Loyal Order of the Moose’s elegant 62-foot ballroom, the city’s first genuine dance floor.  
The Royal Hotel is now a drinking and country dancing establishment, with scheduled live entertainment.

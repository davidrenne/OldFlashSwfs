maple=On this site was one of the city’s earliest commercial buildings, the Foley Block, a wood framed structure that housed two hotels, a school room, a newspaper and the Town Council.  This is where the December, 1891 fire started.
After the fire, this site remained empty until 1899 when the Maple Leaf Hotel was built by John Henry Kern.  Built in the popular French Second Empire Style, it featured a mansard roof, a veranda facing Main Street and a corner pavilion with a tower (since removed).
The Maple Leaf Hotel is now known as the Cornerstone Inn.  No longer used as a hotel, it now contains Brewsters Brew Pub and restaurant.

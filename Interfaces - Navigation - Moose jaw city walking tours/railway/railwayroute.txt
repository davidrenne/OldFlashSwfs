intro=The coming of the railway late in 1882 changed Moose Jaw, almost overnight, from an outpost on a lonely trail to a bustling Prairie town that quickly mushroomed up into tents, shacks and small stores to handle the rush of newcomers.
By May 1883, the population of Moose Jaw fluctuated between 2,000 and 3,000 people with the influx of settlers.
The first edition of the Moose Jaw News appeared May 4, 1883 and commented: “Two months ago the City of Moose Jaw was distinguishable from the boundless prairie only by its natural beauty and two buildings.  Today, it contains upwards of one hundred buildings, many of which are handsome and substantial structures.  There are in Moose Jaw about twenty general merchants whose stocks are large and complete.”
Moose Jaw was incorporated as a town with John Edgar Ross as the first Mayor of Moose Jaw in February 1884 recognizing the importance of Moose Jaw as an important trade centre of the southwest.
A major fire in 1891, which destroyed the first block of Main Street leaving only the Chalmers Store standing, failed to dampen the zeal of the early pioneers.  By 1903, Moose Jaw possessed all the basic essentials of a city and was incorporated as such November 20, 1903.
Beginning at the train station, we can trace the steps of the new settlers and the scene that stretched out before them when they first arrived.  Railway Route walking tour invites you to explore Moose Jaw’s past.

cpr=The present CPR station is the third station to be built in Moose Jaw.  It was built in 1922 to replace a typical “Chateau Style”; a three storied combined hotel and station that had been built in 1899.  In the early days, the huge seating area was almost always full and the famous restaurant to the west of the tunnels attracted diners from across the prairies.  
Note the vaulted ceiling, the company crests and the Great War Memorial.  On the worn floor, the outline of the old kiosk hints at the amount of traffic this station once served.  
To the right of the building, the CPR Gardens extended for more than a city block and acted as an experimental farm, sporting 3,000 trees.
In 1999, the CPR station was sold and is now a retail mall.

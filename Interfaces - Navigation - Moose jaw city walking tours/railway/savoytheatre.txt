savoy=The Woodley and Sharpe block was built in 1904 by Woodley and Sharpe, who were dealers in building materials and coal.  In 1906, they amalgamated with Frank Gobb to form the Pioneer Lumber and Implement Company.
Over the years, this building has housed several different offices, retail stores and theatres.
The Savoy Theatre was opened in 1909.  The crest is still visible above the alley.
The Mini Theatre took its place and is still in business today.

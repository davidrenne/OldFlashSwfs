scott=Construction of the Walter Scott Block, designed by Story and Van Egmond, began in 1911.  When the Walter Scott Block was completed, it was described as the largest office building in the province.  Built by the Moose Jaw Times, the building was named after the first Premier of Saskatchewan.
The basement of the Walter Scott Block extends 16 feet beyond the walls and under the streets.  Note the cracks in the sidewalk.

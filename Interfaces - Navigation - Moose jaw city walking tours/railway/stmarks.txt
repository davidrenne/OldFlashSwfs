marks=The Methodist Church was built in 1900 for $7,500.  Constructed of Moose Jaw red brick, the building seated 400.
In 1907, it was sold and became St. Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church.  In 1916, it became the Canadian Garage, owned by General George Tuxford.  In 1927, the Presbyterians that had not joined the United Church bought the building and named it Knox Presbyterian Church.  In 1970, the name was changed to St. Mark’s. 
Note the outline of the original windows still visible in the stucco.

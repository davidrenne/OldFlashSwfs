cpark=From May to July 1885, 390 men and officers from the Halifax Battalion were camped at Spring Creek (now Crescent Park) which was then the outskirts of town.  It was one of several military units sent from Eastern Canada to quell the Northwest Rebellion.
The park was started in 1906.  A “make work project” during the 30’s resulted in the Serpentine Creek, bridges, islands and flower beds.

russell=In 1910, the Russell Block was erected by the partners Latham, Hopkins and Yip Yee.  The architecture was of the Chicago school.  The block listed Latham’s Hardware, the Chinese Mission, a pool hall, barber shop, Chinese importers and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police as its renters.
Iron railing once surrounded the outer entrance to the basement level on the south side.  This housed the poolroom and barber shop.  Also notable were the attractive marble archway and the tile floor of the main entrance on First Avenue Northwest.
The Russell Block was demolished in 1999.

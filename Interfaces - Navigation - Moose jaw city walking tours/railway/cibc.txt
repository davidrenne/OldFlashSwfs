cibc=The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was built in 1909 on the site of the 1883 Moose Hotel.  It was the first bank built in Moose Jaw with the renaissance revival type of architecture.  The front view of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce featured four imposing stone columns.  The safe installed inside was said to have been the largest ever seen in Moose Jaw.  It stood eight feet high and weighed five tons.
This building was demolished in 1976 and was replaced by the present building.

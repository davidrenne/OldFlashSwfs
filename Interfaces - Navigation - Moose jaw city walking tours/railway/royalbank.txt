royal=Across the street from the Imperial Bank of Canada is the old Royal Bank building, built in 1913 for $100,000.  This magnificent small terracotta building is a flamboyant example of the height of bank architecture.  Reminiscent of a Greek temple with its fluted columns, Corinthian capitals and lotus flower trim, the whole intent was to suggest stability, integrity and decorum.  Note the terracotta crest that crowns the building.
The old Royal Bank building is now the Bank of Montreal.

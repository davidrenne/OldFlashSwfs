elk=Originally on this site was Felix Plante’s Buffalo Store, the headquarters for the great buffalo bone market.  More bones were shipped out of Moose Jaw, to be ground into fertilizer, than any other point in Canada.  By 1891, the area had been picked clean.
Built by John Henry Kern and M.J. MacLeod in 1906, the Elk Block housed the Dominion Land Titles Offices, headquarters for the largest district in the west.  100 visitors a day arrived in Moose Jaw to register their land, often blocking Main Street.
In 1966, the north half of the building burnt to the ground.

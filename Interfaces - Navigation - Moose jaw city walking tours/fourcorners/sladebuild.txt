slade=In 1911, a fire destroyed the Times office on the corner of High Street East and Main Street North.  On January 29, 1912, the Times moved into its new and much larger home at 423 9th Avenue (now called 1st Avenue Northwest).  The new building was called the Times Building, and it housed all the printing equipment, as well as the Times offices, with room for eleven suites as well.
In 1956, it was purchased by Arthur Hercules Slade.  The building was renamed the Slade Building, and renovated so that fourteen new suites were added to the existing eleven.

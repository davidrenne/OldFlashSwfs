park=The development of the park took place in 1930 as a relief project to provide work for people during the Depression.  The project employed 200 men for 25 cents a day plus a meal ticket. 
Several buildings are included in Crescent Park.  The Natatorium, heated with natural hot springs was added in the thirties.  The comfort station originally on Fairford Street was moved, brick by brick, to the park in 1985, it being the only such public convenience left in Saskatchewan and one of the few left in Western Canada.
At the southwest corner of Crescent Park, we find an archway entrance to Crescent Park.  This is the former entrance to the now demolished King Edward School.  The archway was bought from the demolition company for $500.

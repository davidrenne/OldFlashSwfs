fire=The Central Fire Hall was built in 1909 of Portage la Prairie brick.  It is a three story building with a tower 60 feet high.
The main level was originally the stable area for the horses and storage area for equipment.  Above the main level was office space, sleeping quarters for the deputy chief, as well as washroom and kitchen quarters.  The kitchen originally was the living quarters for the chief and his family.  The third floor was sleeping quarters for the night shift.
On the main level beside the tower was the alarm room where calls came in.  The original panel board and machinery installed in 1909 was still in use in 1989.

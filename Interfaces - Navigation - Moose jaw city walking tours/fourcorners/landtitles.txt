titles=The Land Titles Office was built in 1910 to replace the former Dominion Land Titles Office in the Elk Block on lower Main Street.  The Land Titles Office was designed by architects Story and Van Egmond.  The one story brick building features classical Doric columns.  The roof is a flat wood structure.  An addition was made to the building in 1922.  Note the crack separating the two.
According to an article in the newspaper March, 1949, titles to more than 11 million acres of land were kept on file in the Land Titles Office.
The Land Titles Office moved to their new location at 110 Ominica Street West in 1999.  The original Land Titles Office located at 76 Fairford Street West is now the Yvette Moore Fine Art Gallery.

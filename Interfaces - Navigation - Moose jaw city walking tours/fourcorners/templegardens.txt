tg=Temple Gardens was built in 1921 by Calvin and Trudy Temple.  Temple Gardens was the most distinctive building in all of Saskatchewan with its California-Moorish façade.  It was said to be the most elegant dance hall anywhere in the West.
Wednesday was Waltz Night and dances were held every Friday and Saturday night.  It was here that Mart Kenny built his reputation as Canada’s most popular musician.
Temple Gardens remained in operation until 1978.

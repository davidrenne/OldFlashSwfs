capitol=Originally called the Allen Theatre, plans for this theatre started in 1913.  Construction began in 1914 but was halted due to the outbreak of war and the building of a local amusement park, which at that time was considered more important.  In 1916, work resumed and on August 16th of that year, the theatre doors were opened to the public for the first time.  In 1919, the name of the theatre was changed to the Capitol.
The interior is spacious and beautifully decorated.  Note the elaborate brick work and carved “A T” on the parapet.

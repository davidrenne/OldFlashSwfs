bellamy=The building was designed by Architect R.G. Bunyard.  Bricks came from the Dominion Firebrick Company, about 40 miles from Moose Jaw.  An interesting feature is the lovely design in the brickwork, which can be seen on the east and north sides of the building.
Courtesy and efficiency were the byword of service at the Bellamy Furniture Company.  It was not only a furniture house, but also a museum of beautiful art.  One could spend an enlightening hour there, even those who did not intend to purchase.

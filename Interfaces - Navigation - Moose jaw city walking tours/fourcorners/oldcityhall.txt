oldhall=The old City Hall was a red brick building constructed in 1904 with an annex added in 1912.  One room in the City Hall was used as a school.  The top floor housed an Opera House.  The southwest corner of City Hall was used as the Fire Department.
When the Fire Department moved into the Fire Hall built in 1909, the space in the City Hall was renovated to house a Police Court and holding cells.  The first court in the building was held August 16, 1910.

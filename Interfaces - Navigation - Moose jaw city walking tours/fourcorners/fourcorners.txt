fourintro=The Four Corners Walk takes a look at the buildings constructed during the boom years 1910 to 1918 when Moose Jaw’s dreams for the future were reflected in its grand architecture.  Starting and ending in Crescent Park, we can reflect on the early history of Moose Jaw and on a city that is unique to the Province of Saskatchewan.
By 1903, Moose Jaw possessed all the basic essentials of a city and was incorporated as such November 20, 1903.  In that year, Moose Jaw’s future seemed secure.  It was located in the centre of the continent’s great wheat belt and was recognized as an important business and distributing centre with expanding educational, recreational, cultural and medical facilities.  
The establishment of Moose Jaw as an important business, educational and cultural centre in 1903 paved the way for a 10-year population explosion.  By 1913, the population had increased from 2,500 to 14,000. 
By 1914, Moose Jaw was realizing an unprecedented boom.  The city boasted electricity, paved streets and a street railway.
Down through the years, the future of Moose Jaw was entrusted to men and women whose leadership in varied fields, backed by the industry and faith of her citizens, paved the way for the growth of a lively community.
Take a walk back in time with Moose Jaw’s Four Corners Walk and experience the Moose Jaw story spoken through the legacy of historical buildings found on this tour.  Walking Tour brochures can be picked up downstairs at the Art Museum, located in Crescent Park.

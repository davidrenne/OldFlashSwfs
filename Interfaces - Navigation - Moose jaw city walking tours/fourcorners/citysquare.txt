square=The parking lot on the southeast corner of 1st Avenue Northwest and Fairford Street West was once the location of Moose Jaw’s City Square.  This was a small park behind the City Hall.  Several tall trees provided shade, and well tended flowerbeds and shrubs added to the beauty and tranquility of the little park.  The park served as a meeting place for special activities and gatherings for the community of that time.
The City built a parking lot on this site in 1959.

harwood=A group of colonists heading for Saskatoon stopped in Moose Jaw for a period of time, and erected a rough colonization shed on which eventually became the site of the Harwood Hotel.
Richard Harwood started construction of the Harwood Hotel in 1927.  It cost $64,000 to build and was open for business in 1928.
Today, what was previously known as the Harwood, has been remodeled and added on to and is now the Temple Gardens Mineral Spa.

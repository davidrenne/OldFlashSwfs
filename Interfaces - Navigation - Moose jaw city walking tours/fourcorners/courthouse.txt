court=The Court House was built in 1909 and is the oldest continuously functioning court house in Saskatchewan.  It was designed by Darling and Pearson of Toronto.  The Moose Jaw Evening Times reported, “while the design was impressive, it was seen to be too similar to Eastern Banks.”
The building cost $57,000 and was constructed of Bedford Stone and hydraulic pressed brick in the colonial revival style.  The main façade has huge Doric columns of Menonimee brick.
On September 23, 1986, the Court House became the first building in Moose Jaw to receive Heritage status.

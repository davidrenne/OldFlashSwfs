an=This building was constructed in 1918 for $32,000 by the Merchants Bank of Canada.  The building was originally called the Merchants Bank Stores and Office Building and the architect was Story and Van Egmond of Regina.
The four lots originally belonged to the Presbyterian Church who in 1901-2 built a brick church there called St. Andrew’s. 
In 1945, the Army and Navy Department Store occupied the whole building and has been there to present day.  Unfortunately, after 55 years of business, the store is now in the process of closing its doors for good.

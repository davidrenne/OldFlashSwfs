nsbank=The Bank of Nova Scotia was originally built by the Bank of Montreal in 1911.  It was designed by the architect R.G. Bunyard.
The bank is brick with a granite base and stone facings.  There were two main entrances, one to the banking hall and the other to the second floor living quarters.  The main entrance is guarded by two stone pillars.  Above the doorway was a large stone carving.
In 1922, the Bank of Nova Scotia purchased the building, when the Bank of Montreal moved across the street to what is now the Canada Trust.

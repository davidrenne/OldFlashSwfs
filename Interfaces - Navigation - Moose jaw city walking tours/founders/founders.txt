founders=The stately homes and elaborate churches on this walking tour reflect on the political, economic and social contributions to the community during the boom years from the early 1900’s to the First World War.  Highlights on this tour are the homes of three influential families: the Turnbulls, the E.N. Hopkins and the William Graysons.
Dr. Turnbull practiced medicine in Moose Jaw for over forty years until his death in 1926.  He served several years as City Health Officer and helped save lives during the 1918 swine flu epidemic.  Mrs. Turnbull held many social events in the house.  These “At Homes” or teas were an integral part of their social lives in the community.  A news item in the October 1, 1907 Moose Jaw Times read, “Nearly a hundred ladies took advantage of the bright sunshine of Wednesday afternoon to call upon Mrs. Turnbull.”
E.N. Hopkins was the first secretary of the Moose Jaw Board of Trade.  He arrived in Moose Jaw, July 1882.  He was a staunch conservative and a pillar of the Methodist Church.  He was elected to the House of Commons in 1923.
William Grayson is recognized as being one of the most influential and important men to Moose Jaw’s development, from 1884 to 1914.  He was the first lawyer in Moose Jaw and the eighth mayor of the town in 1893.  For 25 years, he was Chairman of the Public School Board.
The most impressive architecture of the houses we see on this walk is a historic reminder of the affluence of many of our founding fathers and their contributions to the community.

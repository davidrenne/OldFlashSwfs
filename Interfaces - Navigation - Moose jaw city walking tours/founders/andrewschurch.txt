andrews=St. Andrew’s was built by Moose Jaw’s Presbyterians in 1912.  Neo-Gothic in design, the structure features a lofty ceiling, a bell tower in cathedral style and an immense stained glass window above the wide stone steps of the entrance.  In 1925, the church joined the United Church of Canada.
In 1936, St. Andrew’s made history by ordaining the first woman minister in the United Church, Lydia Gruchy.
In 1963, the building was gutted by fire.  In 1966, the church reopened.  The large stained glass window, which had been destroyed in the fire, was done to its original design and replaced in May, 1970.

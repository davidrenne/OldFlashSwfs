townbell=The bell was originally bought, on May 16, 1902, from the American Bell Foundry.  It was housed in the old City Hall and was used to signal fire and curfew in the city.  From 1951 to 1972, the bell was located in the bell tower of St. George’s Church.  Later in 1972, the bell was donated to the Art Museum.

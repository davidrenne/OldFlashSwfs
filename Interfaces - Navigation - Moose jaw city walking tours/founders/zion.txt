zion=The Zion Methodist Church was built in 1906, for $90,000, to house a growing congregation.  It is the only remaining church of this design in Western Canada.  It seats 1,200 people.
This stately, symmetrically arranged church is made of Menomme red brick and cut stone.  The front entrance features five Doric columns and four doors which symbolize the four gates to the New Jerusalem. 
The sanctuary is of the centralized design and features a dome 42 feet over head, 38 feet in diameter, with a 16 foot centre of stained glass. 
Two stained glass windows on the lower landing are dedicated to little Herbie Bellamy, a crippled child who died at the age of 12.  
In 1977, a complete renovation and restoration of the interior was carried out with assistance from the provincial government.

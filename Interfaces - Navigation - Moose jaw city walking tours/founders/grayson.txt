grayson=The Grayson House was constructed in 1911-1912 for William Grayson, Moose Jaw’s largest landowner.  The house is constructed in a style known as Georgian Symmetry.  It is made of buff coloured brick.  The interior originally had 22 rooms, featuring oak panelling, decorative glass, elaborate fireplaces and a fine foyer.  A central vacuum system was installed in December 1912.  At one time, it housed Grayson’s impressive European Art Collection.
The original carriage house still stands at the rear of the house, just across the alley.

hopkins=Hopkins House was built in 1912 and was the second residence for Edward Hopkins.  He built this house almost directly across from his former residence on Stadacona Street.
The house is built of red brick, with a fine wide veranda.  Inside was an oak staircase.  The unique light standards once lit the length of Main Street.  Mr. E.N. Hopkins lived in this house until his death, which occurred here in 1935.
The Pierce family purchased the house in 1978 and began restoring the house to make it appear as it might have been when the Hopkins lived in the house.  It is now a restaurant.

edhop=This house, the first to be built in Moose Jaw for the Edward N. Hopkins family, was constructed in 1905.  Mrs. Hopkins held her first reception in her new home on June 22, 1906.  For its debut, it is recorded that the house was decorated with “smilax ferns and sweet peas,” and that “for the first time in Moose Jaw, the ice cream was served in bricks…”
The house once possessed a semi veranda with second floor balcony and is constructed of red brick on a fieldstone basement.  The house was once described as the most northerly house in Moose Jaw.
McMasters Photography Studio now resides at this address.

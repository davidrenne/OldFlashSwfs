turnbull=The corner lot of which the Turnbull House stands was a birthday gift to Ethel Scott, from the town to the first white child born in Moose Jaw, May 4, 1883.  In 1900, she sold the lot to Dr. Turnbull.
The Turnbull House was built in 1906 during prosperous times.  The house is constructed of locally-made red brick, with sandstone trim and a cut fieldstone foundation.  Ionic capitals are used on the porch area.  The use of the tower was characteristic of the Queen Anne Revival style of architecture.  
In 1939, the house was sold to William J. Jones to use as a funeral home and ambulance service.

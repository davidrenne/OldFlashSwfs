library=The library was erected in 1912-1913.  The building was designed by the local firm of Reid and McAlpine.  It was laid out in the shape of a cross.  The yellow brick is known as Dickinson pressed brick.
The library is famous for both its lovely setting and impressive interior.  The ground floor is graced with marble columns and trim, containing more marble than any other building in Saskatchewan except for the Legislative Building.  The second floor has a balcony and high above is a beautiful stained-glass dome.

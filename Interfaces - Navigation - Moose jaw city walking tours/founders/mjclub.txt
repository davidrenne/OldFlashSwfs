mjclub=Across the street, you will see the large red brick building that was once the Moose Jaw Club.  The club was built in 1913-1914 as an exclusive men’s club and featured a dining room, lounge, reading room, billiard room and several card rooms.  The dining room was one of the most impressive rooms in the club, with high ceilings, a large chandelier and a very formal appearance.
The Moose Jaw Club had a membership of over 300 men but almost half were non-residents.  Members who were staying in Moose Jaw from out of town were able to stay in the rooms that were located on the second floor.
Although the club flourished during the 20’s, the economic conditions of the 30’s brought an end to the club.

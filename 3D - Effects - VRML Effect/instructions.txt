Hi,

Create a 6 frame animation that 'simulates' the positions
of a VRML object and render as a sequence of images

Save as, or convert the images,  to .png files


Start Flash

Open the .fla file and select Window/Library

"Right" click "1p" and select "Properties"
Select "Import" and locate the first image from your sequence
Load your image and then click "OK"

Move to "2p" and repeat the procedure for all six images


Save your .fla file then export your .swf movie
To embed it in a webpage.. you can use this code:
<embed src="vrml.swf" width=400 height=400>
(or whatever you name the file you create)
Don't forget to upload the .swf to the same directory!

You are able to save this movie as a 'Flash3' file..
insuring that almost no one will need to get a plug-in

Good luck

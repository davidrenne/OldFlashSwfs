This movie was made especialy for Mark.

You can use it as you want. The only thing i'm asking is to leave the credits at the end of the movie "Created by Yan Theriault".

I do know it's not one of the gretest animation but still, it's only my third one. If you want to see more, i've included a little screensaver i've made (the YoYo Game). You can also find this screensaver as a Preloader on Flashkit.

If you have any other idea for an Ecard... mail it to me. I'll be honnored to work with you....

oh...by the way, as you can see my english is not so good. That's becaus i'm french canadian. If you see any grammatical or other kind of error in the animation, please let me know...

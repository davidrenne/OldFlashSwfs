This is a pretty decent, but simple on/offline detector.

You can easily add your own messages and customize it to fit your app.

You will need to stick a text file on a web server somewhere if you don't want to rely on mine, however I don't plan on moving mine so the detector will work fine out of the box.

Thanks go to Leo Lima, and Funner for their generous input.

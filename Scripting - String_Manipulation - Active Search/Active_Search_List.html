<b><font face="Arial" size="4">Introduction</font></b>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">This is a partial tutorial. I will cover the logic
behind the working of the filtering list. If you are familiar with Flash the
rest of the workings of this project will be relatively easy to grasp. There is
a &quot;SORT&quot; button -- I have the alphabetical sort routine as a separate
tutorial. It is only several lines of code in one frame. BUT it is one of my
worst 200,000 calculation limit offenders. I believe that with two variables
(the button name and the URL it links to) being sorted at a time you will find
it crashes at around 90 items. That is why it is a separate option. To enable it
permanently, simply delete the &quot;SORT&quot; button and set the variable
&quot;alphabetize&quot; that is in frame 1 of the main timeline to
&quot;1&quot;.<br>
<br>
On with the filtering links list. To start, you will find there are many embedded movie clips. This is necessary.
To begin, the entire project is only one movie clip. Not only does this leave
the project tidy and easier to copy and paste into other projects, but it also
allows it to be a draggable object, which it is.<br>
<br>
Inside this complete movie clip, you will find several objects. The only one of
importance is the &quot;weblinks&quot; object. This contains both the interface
that allows the user to type into and also the &quot;scrolltarget&quot;. Just
like we needed a separate object to enable &quot;dragging&quot;, we need a
separate object to &quot;scroll&quot;. Inside the &quot;scroll&quot; object, we
find an object called &quot;allbuttons&quot;, which is a container to hold all
the buttons. (There is only one button until the script runs and starts
duplicating them).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now let's look at the button itself. This is
where all the code is that makes the whole effect work. There are 5 frames. Only
three have any real code in them. Frame 4 is just a loop and Frame 5 is a
&quot;call&quot; routine for
converting to lowercase both the variables and also the user input for purpose
of ignoring case sensitivity. Since this also may cause too many calculations at
some point -- or because some people may want to disable the case
insensitivity... it is also an option. There is a variable on the main timeline.
Set it to either 0 or 1 depending if you want to be able to type &quot;OnLiNe&quot;
and have it find &quot;online&quot; and &quot;Online&quot; as correct results or
not.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Frame 1: Initial Setup</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">In this frame we duplicate the buttons and set the
text in them for the initial list. This is the only time we run this frame --
for the initial setup. (It also gets called again if you hit the
&quot;SORT&quot; button in this demo, or if we ever need to reset the list
completely... for instance, if the user deletes his input entirely.)<br>

to name things that you can remember what they are for months later when you are
trying to change your code. Or, as in this case, if it's someone different
entirely who is trying to read the code than the person who wrote it. People

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Frame 2: Filter the List<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="3">NOTE:</font><font face="Arial" size="4"> </font><font face="Arial" size="3">This
frame does NOTHING first time around.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">This is where the link filtering happens. This is
the only frame in this entire project that is really unique and that I can take
credit for. Although to be honest, I got the idea from Microsoft's
&quot;Help&quot; index system, where this same effect happens. I liked it. I
wanted one. So I made one. There are no really original ideas are there? Just
new implementations of old ones.<br>
<br>
</font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">the LOGIC:<br>
</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">Here is where I sat down with pencil and
paper and pre-thought out exactly what I wanted the script to do in order to
perform the filtering list. In many cases, I highly recommend sitting down with
pencil and paper BEFORE touching the computer. You will end up saving yourself a
LOT of time. It also helps to break large problems into the smallest possible
pieces. The individual components of how this works were easy to solve. When I
first though &quot;Hey this is what I want to do...&quot; the overall project
was to complex for me to solve all at once. So here are the individual
components I broke the problem down to to be more easily programmed:<br>
<br>
I decided:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(a) when the user types, I need to keep track of
what he types live.<br>
(b) as soon as it changes (not all the time -- to save on CPU processing -- no
use continually running this code -- ) start checking.<br>
(c) checking involves the following: comparing the amount of characters that
have already been typed (say there are five) in five character chunks against
the items in the list.<br>
(d) if a match is found, add that item AND ITS LINK to the new list.<br>
(e) I immediately decided I wanted this to work in a non-case sensitive manner.<br>
<br>
Easy, right?<br>
<br>
So there are a number of loops going on.<br>
(a) a continuous loop to check user input.<br>
(b) if typing has occurred, a loop to start checking items one at a time<br>
(c) in each item, checking the text (one)* character at a time.<br>
<br>
*NOTE: You are not really checking one character at a time. You are checking
(user input length) characters at a time. Because it's relatively pointless to
check for one character at a time... (say the user types &quot;e&quot;) -- the
most common character in the English language... well... pretty much every link
is still going to be in your list. There's not much point in that... plus it
uses a lot of processor power. The longer their input the less checking is
required. SO I set a minimum amount of characters to be checked. (currently 3).
If the user hasn't typed at least (3) characters nothing is checked.<br>
<br>
</font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
I have gone to extensive lengths in much of my scripting to avoid the 200,000
calculation limit that Flash has. However, in this links list there really is no
way to avoid it. After you have a certain amount of links, this filtering links
list will generate a huge amount of calculations. It does already. I have not
seen the problem personally on this project but I know it will happen for
someone out there. There are a few things you can do to solve this problem. One
of them is raising the minimum input requirement before the list starts
searching. The higher you set it, the fewer calculations this script will
produce. Even raising it from 3 to 4 will significantly reduce calculations.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Comment: EXPLANATION of code: This one isn't as complicated as it looks. To start, convert use input to lowercase. Fame 2 checks if the user has typed anything more or less than the last time we checked.... if so, control is passed to frame 1. First, we clear the list. Then, Remember, it is LIVE updated. The variable is constantly changing as the user types. (Trace) it to see. Check all imported link descriptions (from 1 to "/:total") for being at least 3 characters long (no point searching for 1 or 2 character words) Search the text description "/:text"&amp;n from the first letter to the last (minus length of "findit") for the character string "findit". If it is found, then add it to the list via duplicate movie clip. Simple - right?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font size="2" face="Arial">In this release of the Active Search List I
have included a variable on the main timeline as an option to be case sensitive
or not. This, again, may or may not be useful to your users, I cannot offhand
think of a case where you would WANT the list to be case sensitive. But it would
reduce a monstrous amount of calculations to do so. This is one more option you
can disable if your list is long enough that it DOES exceed the 200,000
calculation limit. That is the only reason I have set it as a separate variable.<br>

this semi-tutorial, which covers most of the tricky parts of this routine. I

</font><font size="2" face="Arial">The Raygunz game was developed for one
purpose: to test how well a lot of graphics could be made to work in Flash.
There are a number of separate tutorials that make this work... or you could
just download this single file, in which all the following are put together:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">(a) Square Root Function<br>
(b) Detect Mouse Angle<br>
(c) Game Gun<br>
(d) Laser Collision Checking<br>
(e) Terrain Scrolling<br>
<br>
There are also two other &quot;insignificant&quot; little interface tutorials
for the DOS Text Typer and the Value Slider.<br>
<br>
This file is extensively commented and full of notes to explain the theory
behind its working.<br>
<br>
I will not provide any technical support on it. It is for educational purposes.
Use it as you like but don't ask me for help! I had to stop development on this
game because I got an actual job. So its relatively unfinished state you can
blame on my new employer.</font></p>

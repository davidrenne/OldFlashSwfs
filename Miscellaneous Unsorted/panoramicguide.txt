Panoramic View:

1). Open the library for this *.fla
2). Open the MovieClip 'picture holder'
3). Delete the old picture 'Panorama_Vorschau.jpg' 
    from this MC. (i.e. movie-clip).
4). Now import your picture: File/Import placed it
    on the MC 'picture holder' and then CENTER the
    picture - Highlight/mark the picture and do ALIGN.
5). Go 'Scene 1' and see if the picture fits the stage,
    if not choose: Modify/Movie - Dimensions.
6). You can delete the MASK on 'Scene 1' and the Text.

Thanx for the all the people who uploaded their
OPEN-FLAs on various flash-help-sites.
I haven't invented the 360'degrees slider neither
the actionsscripts use in this FLA - its all
based on other peoples work - keep that in mind.

I have done improvemnets  - though :-) and made
it in Flash5 rather than Flash4 using some extra
script that onlu work in only flash5.

There you go - Henrik Dahm, henrik.dahm@mail.dk

OK here are the instructions as by DAVID GEERE (C)2000 Orange.DOT Design

======
This script fades in and out a set of random images, but will never repeat an image untill they have all been displayed.
=====

-------

ONE
-----

open the movie, open the library, open the movie clip called "IMAGES".

Place each of the images you want to display in its own frame.

Open each frames properties and name them 1-whatever number respectively.

Then go back to scene 1.



TWO
-----
on the "PLACE HOLDERS" layer drag the images movie clip onto the page in the places you want images to randomly appear.

Then change the instance of each one to s0 - swhatever you last number.

THREE
-------
go to the first frame in the SCRIPT layer.

change the 2 numbers


FOUR
-----
ur done, just put the boxes where you like.

NOTES
-----
YOU MUST change the n and f variables if you cange anything else, and to change how the images appear just play with the image on the FADE BLOCK layer, change it or delete it if you so wish.

And 

Thats it, heheeh.
thanks

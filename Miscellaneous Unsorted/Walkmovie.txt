This movie is created with flash 4 and poser.
In poser you create the motion, export the files as seperate files, 
import these files into flash and use the trace bitmap settings.
Just experiment with the settings untill you have the right amount
of detail. The imported files are now transformed in vectorfiles.
If you export a movie in Poser as pict sequences you can import that 
sequence in flash. You only have to save these files as a fileformat
that flash can import. Unfortunatelly Flash does not support pict import.
So you need to do that extra step of chaging the fileformat.

You can also fill the figure with one color, add a line and delete the file.
You now have a outline figure of the walking man. 

Have fun and visit my site with lots of animations

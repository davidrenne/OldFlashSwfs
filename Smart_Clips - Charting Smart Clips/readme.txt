This package provides two drag and drop chart types:
Graph and Pie.

The Pie code is based on a Flashkit tutorial by Helen Triolo:
http://www.flashkit.com/cgi-bin/tutorials/jump.cgi?ID=182
which should be helpful if you want to change anything.

Installation
============
Copy "Charting Smart Clips.fla" into your "Macromedia/Flash 5/Libraries/" folder.

To Use
======
Open the library by choosing:
Window->Common Libraries->Charting Smart Clips

Drag the Chart type you want to use onto the stage.

With the chart selected, open the Clip Parameters panel:
Window->Panels->Clip Parameters

Adjust the clip parameters as required.

For an example of scripting the charts,
open "CSC Examples.fla" and take a look
at the actions on frames 2 and 3.

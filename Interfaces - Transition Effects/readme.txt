FREE FLASH FILES

1. What are the free Flash files?

     They are what we call "cookies". Small and sweet :-)

2. Why are we doing them? And for what purpose?

     These files are not tutorials, they were never meant to be. When we have
     time to spare, we experiment with Flash in order to better understand it
     and to create something nice/interesting.

     We thought that others could benefit from them too, so we have opened a 
     new section within our site and offered these files for free download to 
     play with and maybe /learn/ a bit.

5. Terms of usage

     When you open a file in Flash, you agree that you may use all these files for
     personal purposes only. 

     This means that you are free to look at the source code and learn from it, and 
     make other works based on the original file. You may also include the compiled
     .swf file in a personal web site (you are encouraged to credit us).

     You may not redistribute the source file in any form (like offering it for 
     download) and you may not use it for commercial purposes (like including it in 
     your client's site) without our permission. Write us at dvinfo@media-division.com 
     for details.

"Save the Kooshies" was originally "Kryptonite" and was made for a 7th grade
English project. The project topic was "8 parts of Speech". Our task was to
make a way to teach ourselves the 8 parts of speech. To sum it up, everone
else did a Jeopardy-like thing, while we were the only ones that had a 
video game!

Similar to the MICHAEL YORDAN TO THE MAX (www.michaelyordantothemax.com) web-page, this effect shifts a scrolling image to a certain coordinate (X & Y). 
If you use this engine for interface,dont make same mistake like person who has created MJ TO THE MAX web-page!
Before scrolling begin,i sugest that u first make some serius ALPHA on background image if u have one,cause frame rate on MJOTM is joust horrible.
I hope you find this usefull!

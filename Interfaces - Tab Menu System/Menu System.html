<p><font face="Arial">This menu system is a 7K &quot;.fla&quot; file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">How did I fit all these graphics into such a small space?
By using Duplicate Movie Clip. If you ever use the same artwork over and over,
you can save space by doing things this way. There is a lot more programming
involved so for those who are programming-shy, stick to putting the separate
menus into separate frames and use &quot;Go To&quot; buttons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This menu system could be evolved in many ways: You could
make the menus drag down by pulling on the bottom right corner (like your
browser window). You could make the contents much larger than the size of the
menu and add scroll bars. (Like a browser window). You could even make it so you
could drag off individual menus and have them float separately. You could go all
out and make the menus draggable and DOCKABLE to the side of your screen (like
the Flash Toolbar, which can be dragged free or docked.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You could also go insane trying to do this with Flash and
all the variables that would require. : ) And at THAT point, you have to
consider&nbsp; if the extra file size is worth all that interactivity and time
investment.<br>
Don't say I didn't warn you!</font></p>

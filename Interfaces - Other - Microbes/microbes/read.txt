Yes this animation is an Eric Jordan ripoff....So stop it, I know you where thinking that.

I should note that the music is sampled from Depeche Mode, Future Sounds of London, and Children of the Bong.

The photos are from the IMSI Masterclips Browser pack.

Use this file and improve on it.

The buttons and movies clips could have been better scripted, like using the load movie command and other functions, 
but since I knew that this would be trash I really didn't bother using all that jazz and I just got bored building it.

Enjoy

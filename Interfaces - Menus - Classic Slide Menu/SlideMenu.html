<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Here is a sliding menu system that
works via Duplicate Movie Clip. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">When you start, you set up the names of
the menus you want. (Look at the variables in Frame 1). You can add as many as
you want and it will work. THEN, you name the first frame in a new scene after
the menu item. (Look at frame 1 of each scene).&nbsp; When you click on these
buttons, Flash takes the name of the menu and performs a GOTO FRAME (Named after
the button). </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">There are a lot of comments in here to
explain any of the tricky parts. Basically, if you understand duplicate movie
clip, the naming of variables (text boxes) and referring to objects outside
their own timelines.... this shouldn't be too too difficult to grasp. There's a
little algebra involved in duplicating the movie clips horizontally.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">There are a few catches to this menu
system.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1) At any given time you can see a certain
amount of menus on the screen. Say that you can see 5. The way this system works
is Flash duplicates TWICE as many movie clips as there are&nbsp; menus and puts
them to the right. While it scrolls left, this is a good thing. Then when you
scroll things to the right, those disappear and Flash duplicates another set to
the left. NOW.... what if you only have 2 menu items? Things will look kind of
silly won't they? So don't do that! (You can try this by setting the variable
&quot;tmi&quot; (total menu items) in Frame 1 to &quot;2&quot; and see what I
mean.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2) It seems to work kind of slow in some
browsers?(uncertain of this).&nbsp; I originally created this to be used as part of a much larger interface
on a CD-ROM. When you set the frame rate to 120FPS in Flash, you get much
smoother scrolling than if you leave the Frame Rate at ... say ... 24. Try it.
Off a CD-ROM it works perfectly.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">3) The whole thing is fairly tidy but
certainly on optimized in terms of using the least amont of code or items to do
this. That's because This was my first Flash project and I'm no programmer. Hey,
this took me a couple of solid weeks to get it to work right the first time! If
it's messy from a programming point of view that's why.</font></p>

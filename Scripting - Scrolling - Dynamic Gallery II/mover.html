<!--1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 It's the simple things in life that explain stuff a whole lot better. This is the next FLA in my image moving series. I becam increasingly  frustrated when even simple tasks had been overlooked like this  continuous scroller. Simple idea, use one movie clip and make it appear to be an infinate loop. MOVIE CONTROL: The two clips at the bottom are paused movie clips. When you clcik the  up arrow, that tells one movie to play, and stop when you release the  button. The movie loops to check if the 1,2,3,4 clip has passed a certain Y co-ordinate, if true, the movie clip is repositioned so it appears to loop forever. NB the actual clip is duplicated 3 times in a strip. Unlock the masked layer and take a look. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"

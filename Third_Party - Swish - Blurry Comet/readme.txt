Before using the movie, please install the Carr Space font in the 
C:\Windows\Fonts directory (included in the zip file). Unfortunately, I lost the
original Readme file included with the font, but it was made by Alan Carr, and
is freeware. However, I don't recommand you redistribute without permission.

The movie shows how you can make effective use of dingbats in a Swish movie.
It took 10 minutes to make, by the way. Any question/comments can be e-mailed
at pmineault@vif.com. Thanx for downloading!

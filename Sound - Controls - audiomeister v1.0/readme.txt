Audiomeister v1.0 (C)2000 SubKloda Design

This archive is for educational or non-commercial use.
I would regard it as "acknowlegdementware" for the time and
effort that has been put into it...(at least a whole day :) )
If you do decide to use it, then a link or a mention would be nice.

Brief Description of Controls

     As seen on Gmuk.com, the draggable button controls what frame a movie shows. It's fairly simple: depending on the _x position of the bar, the info Movie Clip goes to a certain frame. If you want to add more frames, just put in more variables and if statements. This could be usefull as a menu where each frame is a different button to enter a section. I've also added inertia, and a bounce when the button reaches the edge.
     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise.

Summary
Cookie Crumbs version E is an example of interaction between JavaScript cookies and Flash movies.
The cookie stores the username, the language preference and the background color preference of the user in a query string. When the page is loaded, the OBJECT/EMBED tags of the Flash movie is written dynamically by JavaScript and the query string (the cookie values) is added at the end of the movie name.
The Flash movie displays the username in a dynamic text box, loads a text file in the specified language (English, French or German) and sends the background movie-clip to a specific key-frame according to the user's choice.

Issues and bugs
Reloading the page doesn't always work. You may have to close the window and reopen it again after a few minutes.

Note
The excerpt in the text file is taken from Lewis Carroll's poem entitled "Jabberwocky" ("Through the Looking-Glass").

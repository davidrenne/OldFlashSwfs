Multi Vision


You may do what you wish with the fla.

- To take away the links to my website and email, remove the top layer called, 'remove this layer'

- To change what the image looks like before the scope goes over it, edit the layer 'outside the scope'

- To change what the image looks like inside scope, edit the layer 'inside the scope'

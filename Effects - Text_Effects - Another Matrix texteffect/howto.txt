1. Create an alphabet of the letters you want to use.

   NOTE: this FLA uses a copyrighted font, Frutiger.
   If you do not have this font on your system the letters
   might not come out right.

2. Create a movie clip for each letter that has to be
   animated. The movie clip contains the letters leading up
   to the final one appearing and fading out, with the final
   letter staying at the top.

3. Line up the movie clips on the stage.

4. Make the movie clips fade out slowly as soon as they
   appear. Also don;t make them appear all at once, but
   "scatter" the appearances.

5. There is no 5. You're done.


You can play around with the timing and which letters to
use for the leading-up fades as much as you want. In this
samply I just followed the alphabet.

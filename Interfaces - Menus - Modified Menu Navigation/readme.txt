This product was developed by me, David Schmitt.  Feel free to modify it and use it for your own - or company - use.  All I ask is that you send me an e-mail (Schnutty_15@yahoo.com) and let me know that you're using it.  I would just like to know for personal reference that this program is helping people out.  In addition, if you have any questions or modifications, feel free to e-mail me as well.  Thanks, and happy flashing.

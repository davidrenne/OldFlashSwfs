Strolling

I have seen this effect on many web-pages, most memoraley http://www.yugop.com , and I decided to recreate it. It's alot easier then any other effect of this kind that I have seen. This is a great file to learn how to use if statements, and how to shift an oject along the coordinate plane.

     These experiments are provided "as is," please do not e-mail me asking about them, unless it's praise, because everyone loves praise. Feel free to use this sample on your site, or any where else for that matter, but please link back to http://www.systern.com or witness my wrath. As always, I am not responsible if you or your computer get hurt in any way fatal, or partial, during,before, or after the use of this file.

I hope you find this usefull, and spread the love around. Drive safely!

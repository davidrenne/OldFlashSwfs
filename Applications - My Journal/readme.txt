&Date=readme&notes=Here's my first serious attempt at an interactive application - a journal that will save and load to your hard drive.Place the movie and the readme file in a folder on your hard drive. Run the movie and type 'readme' in the small box on the page and then click load - you can then scroll through the file using the arrows. You can also play about saving and loading your own journal entries!!haroldhare@btinternet.com&TextField4=This is my first serious attempt at creating an interactive application using Flash - I'm a complete newbie (Nov 2000). I'm working on a multimedia application which will run from cd (it could work on the net I guess but it's going to be BIG - audio, video etc.) One of the features I wanted to create was an interactive journal - and after many sleepless nights, much surfing and emailing the forums - here is the fruit of my labour! Big thankx to Vaughn, SX and John at developette as well as others who continually contribute to the learning curve - you guys are great. This may not look like much - the graphics were done quickly to serve the function and there is much to do yet  - all additions and improvements welcome but please email them through to me so that I can continue to make this thing better.&constructor=[type Function]&__proto__=[object Object]&filename=This is my first serious attempt at creating an interactive application using Flash - I'm a complete newbie (Nov 2000). I'm working on a multimedia application which will run from cd (it could work on the net I guess but it's going to be BIG - audio, video etc.) One of the features I wanted to create was an interactive journal with save, load and scroll features - and after many sleepless nights, much surfing and emailing the forums - here is the fruit of my labour! Simply type todays date (or any tag you like) into the small box and then type in your entry on the main page, click save and hey! It's on your hard drive in the folder you have run this movie from. You can then reload it by typing the date in (unless it's already there) and clicking load. You can then read and or edit the text before saving it again. Big thanx to Vaughn, SX and John Davey at developette as well as others who continually contribute to the learning curve - you guys are great. This may not look like much - the graphics were done quickly to serve the function and there is much to do yet  - all additions and improvements welcome but please email them through to me so that I can continue to make this thing better.If you ahve any ideas about how I can create a variable that reads and displays todays date in the 'date' textbox as a string to save having to type it in I'd be interested to hear from you. Also any way of performing a search of files saved so that they can be selected and loaded in - this function would allow this application to be used as a general file reader, even an ebook reader if the files were in .txt format. I'd also like the code for smooth scrolling - I know it can be done by creating blank movies and using maxscroll etc but I need some sleep! The forums at www.flashkit.com and www.Actionscripts.org are a must for anyone trying to learn flash. If you share this movie around please include the readme.txt as I'd like as much feedback as possible (the 'blank.txt' is needed to clear the page so must also be included) - cheers. haroldhare@btinternet.com&Count=44

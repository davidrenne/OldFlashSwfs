Hello there,

first I would like to say thank you for looking at the text file :)
you are amoung the very few who even care to take the time to read
more about the author of these free FLA's :)

I COMMEND YOU!

If you use this file let me know, it would be cool to see it in use,
if you use the idea of letters for creating abstract figures let me 
know I'd love to see those too.

Basicly just let me know what you think about this idea I love feed
back.


Have fun with it and Be Creative

later

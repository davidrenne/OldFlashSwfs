GAME_STUFF=When one of the text fields
reaches a vertical position defined
within flash, it automatically returns
to the bottom of the scroller and 
picks up another piece of text.

The text can be from an internal
variable, or from an external source
such as a file. This is a good
example of what String.indexOf can do.

The variable index is used as a 
start point and end as the end point
for use with String.slice.

Carriage return characters "\r" are
used in order to search for lines
of text.

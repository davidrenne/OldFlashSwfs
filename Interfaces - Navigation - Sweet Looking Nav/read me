+-- e.d. conditional navigation --+
=======================================

the source files contained within are open source. 
and they are not complete. but they contain a solid
start in the development of a conditional nav sys.

if you employ any part of these files, please email
me:: ericd@directechemerge.com

i'd like to see what you do with it. i left a little mc
of myself (with the ir filter on the dig camera to
make myself look goofy). 

have fun!

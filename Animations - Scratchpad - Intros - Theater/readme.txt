Theater - by Iguana Web Design 

This is fairly simple:
We first placed background graphics, such as the seats etc., and then added
moving lights (fading away) and curtains (done using scale option).
You can add your own movie to the file, by placing it behind the curtains.
Add some music to the file for a better effect.
You are free to use this file in any way you want.

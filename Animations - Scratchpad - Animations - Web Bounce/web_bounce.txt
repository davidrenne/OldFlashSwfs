Bouncing & Reflections :
---------------------------
by Marco Lapi - April 2000

This is a simple example on how you can embellish text and objects.

Reflections are made by using modified versions of the original objects :
I just squeezed them on Y-axis leaving the same width. Then set the alpha
to some 25% or less to achieve the "reflection" idea.

Making the object BOUNCE is just a basic repetition of up and down motion
adding some "easy in/out" effect to the tweening (justtake a look to the .fla)

Also notice in the source ,how objects are distorted and alpha-ed during
the bounce scene.

Another of my cartoon.

Those cartoons are all based on a true story. This one is especially based on mine...realy.

Use it as you want. The only thing i'm asking is to leave the credits at the end of the movie "Created by Yan Theriault". I've also included the font you need to change the dialog, and a Screensaver version.

If you have any other idea for an Ecard... mail it to me. I'll be honnored to work with you....

oh...by the way, as you can see my english is not so good. That's because i'm french canadian. If you see any grammatical or other kind of error in the animation, please let me know...

many thanks to CreedCrow who chcked out the dialog and the spelling for me...

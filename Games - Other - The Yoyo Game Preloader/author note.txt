Hi there...

as you will see, the movie is really simple. It might look like a complex programming but not at all. I know nothing about actionscripting and all these things. The game itself is just a "goto" concept. It's only a little time wasting game. You can use it as a preloader. Just ad a "On frame loaded" to get to your main content.

It IS FREE!!! THE ONLY THING I AM ASKING YOU, IF YOU USE IT, IS TO LEAVE MY NAME AND EMAIL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOVIE.

If you have any other suggestions, i'll be happy to work with you.

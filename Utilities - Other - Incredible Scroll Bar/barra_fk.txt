* How to use:
   Play the movie use the scroll bar as you are used to operate it
   in Windows.
   You can press one arrow and wait for a smoothly dislocating, you
   can press in the middle of bar for a jump movement, drag the
   moving bar or just giving simple clicks on the arrows.

* Tip:
   To create a window uses mask to give boundary to your movie clip.

* Changing the Parameters:
   If you are working with two bars (vertical, horizontal), give them different instance names;
   In Clip Parameters you will adjust:
   -> pos_atual (the current amount of scroll the bar should perform)
   -> clip_associado (the instance name of the animation the bars will work on)
   -> fator_deslocamento (in pixels, tells the amount of scroll in each single click in extreme arrows of the bar)
   -> deslocamento_max (in pixels, tells the maximum scroll the bar could perform)
   -> direcao ("vertical": scrolls in vertical, "horizontal": scrolls in horizontal)
   -> taxa_repeticao (in frames, the time the bar should wait since the mouse is pressed on an arrow intending to dislocate it smoothly)
   -> perc_minima (in percent - eg.: 0.25 - indicates how small the moving bar can be relative to the width/height of the bar without the arrows)
   -> perc_maxima (in percent - eg.: 0.50 - indicates how big the moving bar can be relative to the width/height of the bar without the arrows)
